An app developed in 10 weeks for Northwestern University's Rapid Prototyping class.

EzCal is designed to be a fast, convenient, and secure way of sharing your schedule with your friends! It uses the Google Calendar API to fetch the events on your main Google Calendar and maps them onto a custom 7-day calendar view.

Then, use the handy link to share your week with your friends, without letting them know exactly what you're doing. The app also lets you add events directly to your Google Calendar, and to that of anyone whose schedule you're viewing.

Ideal for scheduling one-on-one tutoring appointments, meetings, or even just hanging out!
